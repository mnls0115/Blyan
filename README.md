# Blyan Network: Transparent, Trustworthy AI for Everyone 🌟

**Imagine an AI that can't lie to you, can't be secretly modified, and belongs to everyone – not just tech giants.**

We built Blyan because the future of AI is too important to leave in the hands of a few corporations. Every decision your AI makes should be transparent, every improvement should benefit everyone, and every person should have the right to contribute to and verify the intelligence that shapes our world.

## 🌍 Why We Built This

**Problem**: Today's AI is a black box controlled by Big Tech
- You can't verify what the AI actually learned or why it gives certain answers
- Only massive corporations can afford to train and improve AI models  
- Your data trains their models, but the benefits don't come back to you
- AI decisions affect everyone, but only a few control how AI evolves

**Our Solution**: AI that lives on the blockchain
- **🔍 Transparent AI**: Every weight, every decision, every improvement is recorded immutably on the blockchain
- **🌐 Democratized Development**: Anyone can contribute to and improve AI models, not just tech giants
- **🤝 Community Owned**: AI that evolves through collective intelligence, with rewards for contributors
- **⚡ Proof of Learning (PoL)**: Instead of wasting energy on meaningless computations, the network grows smarter

## 🔗 Connect Your Node

Join the network and earn rewards by contributing compute power to run **GPT OSS 20B model**:

```python
from client.blyan_client import BlyanNode, NodeRunner

# Connect your GPU to the Blyan network
node = BlyanNode(
    node_id="your-gpu-node", 
    host="your-ip-here",
    port=8001,
    available_experts=["layer0.expert0", "layer1.expert1"]
)

# Start earning rewards for AI inference
runner = NodeRunner(node, api_url="http://api.blyan.com")
await runner.run()  # Ctrl+C to stop
```

**💰 Network Economics**: 
- **Base Model**: GPT OSS 20B distributed across expert nodes
- **Rewards**: BLY tokens paid for successful inference completion
- **Important**: You need sufficient inference volume to earn meaningful rewards
- **Payment**: Automatic distribution based on actual usage and performance

## 🧠 Revolutionary Technology

### Mixture-of-Experts DAG (MoE DAG)
Instead of massive monolithic models, Blyan uses specialized AI "experts" that work together:
- **Efficiency**: Only activate the experts needed for your specific question
- **Evolution**: Each expert can improve independently 
- **Transparency**: See exactly which experts contributed to your answer
- **Collaboration**: Experts from different contributors work seamlessly together

### Proof of Learning (PoL)
Unlike Bitcoin's wasteful Proof of Work, our consensus mechanism makes AI smarter:
- **Meaningful Computation**: Every "mining" operation improves the network's intelligence
- **Democratic Validation**: Quality improvements are verified by the community
- **Continuous Growth**: The network becomes more intelligent over time
- **Energy Efficient**: Computational power goes toward useful AI advancement

### Genesis Block: The Human-AI Covenant 
Our blockchain contains an immutable pact ensuring AI remains beneficial:
- Permanent commitment to transparency and human values
- Cryptographically enforced ethical guidelines
- Community governance over AI development
- Protection against malicious model modifications

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start for Developers

```bash
# Setup environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize the network (one-time setup)
python -c "
import json
from pathlib import Path
from backend.core.chain import Chain

root_dir = Path('./data')
meta_chain = Chain(root_dir, 'A')
spec = {
    'model_name': 'gpt_oss_20b',
    'architecture': 'mixture-of-experts', 
    'num_layers': 24,
    'num_experts': 16,
    'routing_strategy': 'top2'
}
meta_chain.add_block(json.dumps(spec).encode(), block_type='meta')
print('✅ Blyan network initialized')
