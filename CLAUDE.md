## üîê CRITICAL SECURITY REMINDERS

### Main Node (Service Node) Security
1. **The Digital Ocean server (165.227.221.225 / blyan.com) is the MAIN NODE (service node)**
2. **Main nodes DO NOT need API keys** - They bypass authentication
3. **NEVER upload these secrets to Git or anywhere else:**
   - `BLYAN_MAIN_NODE_SECRET` - Only exists on the Digital Ocean server
   - `BLYAN_MAIN_NODE_TOKEN` - Only exists on the Digital Ocean server
   - These must be unique values generated with `secrets.token_hex(32)`
4. **The .env file on the server contains sensitive data and should NEVER be copied to local development**
5. **GPU nodes are different** - They connect TO the main node and may need authentication

### Key Generation Security
- Secrets are generated using Python's `secrets.token_hex(32)` which is cryptographically secure
- This generates 64 hex characters from 32 bytes of random data (2^256 possibilities)
- The probability of collision is essentially zero
- NEVER manually copy/paste these values - always generate new ones

### Authentication Architecture
- Main node (Digital Ocean server) = Service provider, doesn't need API keys
- GPU nodes = Service consumers, connect to main node, may need authentication
- Health endpoint (`/health`) bypasses all authentication for monitoring

### Node Types & Deployment
- **Main Node (Service Node)**: Digital Ocean server (165.227.221.225 / blyan.com)
  - Runs the main API and blockchain
  - Does NOT need API keys
  - Uses `api/server.py` as entrypoint
- **GPU Nodes**: Distributed compute providers
  - Need `BLYAN_API_KEY` to register with main node
  - Must set `BLOCKCHAIN_ONLY=false` to actually serve models
  - Use `runpod_node.py` as entrypoint
  - Require public IP/DNS and port forwarding
  - See [GPU Node Deployment Guide](docs/GPU_NODE_DEPLOYMENT.md) for setup

## Project Overview

Blyan is a revolutionary distributed MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) blockchain system that hosts evolving AI models using DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure. Each expert is stored as an independent block, enabling selective inference, partial mining, and distributed computing. The system has evolved into a **self-learning, evolving AI organism** rather than static data storage.

## Development Setup

### Environment Setup
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Initialize Genesis Block
Before first run, create the meta-chain genesis block with MoE specification:
```bash
python - <<'PY'
import json
from pathlib import Path
from backend.core.chain import Chain

root_dir = Path("./data")
meta_chain = Chain(root_dir, "A")
spec = {
    "model_name": "gpt_oss_20b",  # Must match model in ./models/ directory
    "architecture": "mixture-of-experts", 
    "num_layers": 24,
    "num_experts": 16,
    "routing_strategy": "top2"
}
meta_chain.add_block(json.dumps(spec).encode(), block_type='meta')
print("‚úÖ Meta chain initialized with MoE architecture.")
PY
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: The `model_name` must match a directory in `./models/` (e.g., `./models/gpt-oss-20b/`)

**Note**: DAG validation is temporarily optimized for performance with large expert uploads. Cross-chain dependencies between meta-chain (A) and parameter-chain (B) have been resolved.

### Running the Application
- **Multi-Server**: `./server.sh start` (API + P2P nodes)
- **API Only**: `./server.sh start api` (runs on http://0.0.0.0:8000)
- **Frontend**: Open `frontend/index.html` directly in browser (no build step required)
- **Server Status**: `./server.sh status` to check all services
- **Restart**: `./server.sh restart` to apply code changes

### Security Notes
- Use SSH keys instead of passwords for server access
- Configure firewall (ufw) to restrict access
- Consider using SSL/TLS certificates with Let's Encrypt
- Regularly update system packages and dependencies

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **Chain (`backend/core/chain.py`)**: DAG blockchain with cycle detection and topological sorting
- **Block (`backend/core/block.py`)**: DAG block structure with expert metadata and dependencies
- **MoEModelManager (`backend/model/moe_infer.py`)**: Selective expert loading and MoE inference
- **DistributedInferenceCoordinator (`backend/p2p/distributed_inference.py`)**: P2P expert coordination
- **ExpertUsageTracker**: Real-time expert performance and reward tracking
- **API Server (`api/server.py`)**: Comprehensive REST API with MoE and distributed inference

### DAG Blockchain Structure
- **Meta-chain (A)**: Stores model architecture and routing rules (`block_type: 'meta'`)
- **Parameter-chain (B)**: Stores individual expert weights as DAG blocks (`block_type: 'expert'`, `'router'`)
- **DAG Dependencies**: Blocks have `depends_on` field enabling parallel expert evolution
- **Block Types**: `meta`, `expert`, `router` for different AI components
- **Cycle Detection**: `has_cycle()` and `topological_sort()` ensure DAG validity

### MoE Data Flow
1. Meta-chain defines MoE model architecture and expert configuration
2. Each expert stored as independent block with `expert_name` and `layer_id`
3. **Selective Loading**: MoEModelManager loads only required experts for inference
4. **Router Logic**: Router blocks define expert selection strategies
5. **Usage Tracking**: ExpertUsageTracker records performance for dynamic rewards
6. **Distributed Inference**: P2P coordinator distributes experts across nodes

### Enhanced File Structure
- `backend/core/`: DAG blockchain with cycle detection and expert filtering
- `backend/model/`: MoE inference with selective expert loading and usage tracking
- `backend/p2p/`: Distributed inference coordination and expert node management
- `miner/`: MoE model extraction and expert-specific upload tools
- `scripts/`: Testing and demonstration tools for distributed MoE

### Advanced Mining & Inference
- **Individual Expert Extraction**: `scripts/extract_individual_experts.py` separates MoE model into individual expert blocks for diverse routing
- **MoE Expert Upload**: `upload_moe_parameters.py` extracts and uploads MoE models (creates single unified expert block)
- **Selective Inference**: Load only required experts based on content-aware routing decisions
- **Content-Based Routing**: Router analyzes prompt characteristics to select optimal experts dynamically
- **Blockchain-First Generation**: Reconstruct models entirely from Expert block weights for true decentralized inference
- **Distributed Computing**: Experts run on specialized nodes with load balancing and heartbeat monitoring
- **Quality-Based Rewards**: Dynamic reward calculation based on usage, speed, and quality with ExpertUsageTracker
- **Expert Evolution**: Independent expert improvement through DAG versioning
- **Performance Optimization**: DAG validation optimized for large tensor uploads
- **P2P Node Registry**: Complete distributed inference coordination with node registration/discovery
- **Donor Mode System**: Nodes contribute compute without rewards to support free-tier users (EMA-based utilization tracking)
- **Distributed Streaming**: Real-time token streaming with progressive handoff and speculative decoding
- **Consensus Learning**: Byzantine fault-tolerant distributed learning with synchronized epochs

## Critical Implementation Requirements

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Blockchain-First Inference**
**All inference MUST use parameters from blockchain blocks, not base model weights**

The core principle of Blyan is that inference should reconstruct the model using Expert blocks from the blockchain, ensuring:
- **Transparency**: Every weight used is traceable to a specific block
- **Decentralization**: No reliance on centralized model files
- **Evolution**: Model behavior evolves as new Expert blocks are added
- **Proof-of-Learning**: Only quality-validated Expert weights are used

Current implementation correctly loads Expert blocks (`‚úì Loaded expert layer0.expert0`) but inference should reconstruct the full MoE model from blockchain state, not fall back to base model files.

### Production MoE Inference Flow
1. **Load Meta-chain**: Get model architecture and routing strategy
2. **Select Experts**: Use routing logic to choose required Expert blocks
3. **Reconstruct Model**: Build MoE model from Expert block weights only
4. **Generate**: Perform inference using blockchain-reconstructed model
5. **Track Usage**: Record Expert usage for reward calculation

## Donor Mode System (NEW!)

### Overview
Donor mode allows nodes to contribute computing power without expecting rewards, specifically to support free-tier users. The system uses sophisticated tracking to prevent abuse while maintaining fairness.

### Key Features
- **EMA-Based Utilization**: Exponential Moving Average (Œ±=0.1) for stable utilization measurement
- **Queue Management**: 30-second timeout prevents infinite waiting for free-tier requests
- **Reputation Windows**: 10-minute sliding windows with 5-minute grace period for new nodes
- **Byzantine Tolerance**: Filters out unhealthy nodes automatically

### Configuration
```bash
# Environment variables
export DONOR_MODE_ENABLED=true
export DONOR_MODE_FREE_TIER_LIMIT=100  # requests/day
export DONOR_MODE_QUEUE_TIMEOUT=30     # seconds
```

### API Endpoints
```bash
# Get donor statistics (cached 10s)
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/p2p/donor_stats"

# Check operational metrics
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/metrics/donor"
```

## Distributed Streaming System (NEW!)

### Overview
Real distributed streaming replaces mock token generation with actual distributed routing and progressive handoff capabilities.

### Streaming Modes
1. **Single-Node Streaming**: Optimal node streams all tokens
2. **Progressive Handoff**: Seamless transition between nodes mid-stream
3. **Speculative Decoding**: Fast draft (40 tok/s) + verification (10 tok/s)

### Configuration
```bash
# Enable streaming features
export ENABLE_STREAMING=true
export ENABLE_SPECULATIVE=true
export STREAMING_TIMEOUT=60  # seconds
```

### Testing
```bash
# Test basic streaming
python scripts/test_streaming.py

# Test speculative decoding
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "test", "use_moe": true, "stream": true, "enable_speculative": true}'
```

## Consensus Learning System (NEW!)

### Overview
Solves the fundamental distributed learning problem where nodes diverge due to training from different base states.

### Key Components
- **Synchronized Epochs**: All nodes agree on base version before training
- **Byzantine Aggregation**: Krum and trimmed mean for fault tolerance
- **Delta Compression**: 20-50x compression with INT8+Sparse+LoRA
- **Blockchain Integration**: Consensus blocks with cryptographic commitments

### Demo
```bash
# Run consensus learning demo
python scripts/demo_consensus_learning.py

# Shows:
# - Synchronized base version agreement
# - Local training on agreed base
# - Delta aggregation with Byzantine tolerance
# - Blockchain commit of consensus delta
```

### Implementation
```python
from backend.learning.consensus_learning import ConsensusLearningCoordinator

# Initialize coordinator
coordinator = ConsensusLearningCoordinator(
    node_id="node_1",
    blockchain_manager=blockchain
)

# Run learning round
await coordinator.run_learning_round(
    tile_id="layer0.expert0.weight",
    dataset_batch=training_data
)
```

## Key Commands for Development
