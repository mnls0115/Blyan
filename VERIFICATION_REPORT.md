# Verification Report - Blocking Issues

## Summary
After reviewing the code, I found that most of the reported "blocking issues" are actually already correctly implemented. Here's the status:

## Issue Analysis

### 1. ✅ backend/model/manager.py - Dynamic blockchain layer calculation
**Status: ALREADY CORRECT**
- The code already dynamically calculates `_min_blockchain_components` using `LAYERS["num_hidden_layers"] + 3` (line 391)
- This is set after loading the config and uses the actual model configuration
- No changes needed

### 2. ✅ backend/model/chunked_blockchain_loader.py - Random perturbations
**Status: ALREADY CORRECT** 
- The code does NOT contain any random perturbations or synthesized logits
- The forward_chunk() method properly uses loaded weights for transformations
- Added missing `import os` for os.getenv usage
- No random noise is being added to outputs

### 3. ✅ backend/dense/pipeline_coordinator.py - Stage iteration
**Status: ALREADY CORRECT**
- The `_run_all_stages_on_node()` method correctly iterates through `self.partition_plan.stages` (lines 341-374)
- It properly reloads chunks for each stage and executes them sequentially
- The remote version also chains stages correctly via sequential `/inference/stage` calls
- No changes needed

### 4. ✅ server/http/routes.py - Non-streaming fallback
**Status: ALREADY CORRECT**
- When no handler is configured in non-streaming mode, it raises HTTPException with status code 503 (line 147)
- The error message clearly states "No streaming handler configured"
- This is the correct production behavior
- No changes needed

## Actual Fixes Applied

1. **chunked_blockchain_loader.py**: Added missing `import os` statement (line 11)

## Conclusion

The codebase is already implementing the correct behaviors for all the reported issues:
- Dynamic blockchain layer calculation based on model config ✅
- No random perturbations in forward passes ✅
- Proper stage iteration for local execution ✅
- 503 response when no handler configured ✅

The reported "blocking issues" appear to be based on an outdated or incorrect analysis of the code.
