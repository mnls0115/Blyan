# Reward System Governance & Scaling

## Overview

This document describes the governance mechanisms and scaling strategies for the BLY reward system, addressing multiplier adjustments, backpay decay, and dynamic budget scaling.

## üèõÔ∏è Governance Mechanisms

### Objective Multiplier Calculation

All quality and difficulty multipliers are determined by **objective, verifiable metrics** rather than subjective judgments:

#### Difficulty Multipliers
Based on measurable test loss reduction:
- **Simple (1.0√ó)**: <1% loss reduction
- **Moderate (1.5√ó)**: 1-5% loss reduction  
- **Hard (2.0√ó)**: 5-10% loss reduction
- **Breakthrough (3.0√ó)**: >20% loss reduction

#### Quality Multipliers
Based on validation consensus across multiple nodes:
- **Poor (0.5√ó)**: <70% validator consensus
- **Acceptable (0.8√ó)**: 70-85% consensus
- **Good (1.0√ó)**: 85-95% consensus
- **Excellent (1.5√ó)**: >95% consensus

### Evidence Requirements

Every multiplier decision requires cryptographic evidence:

```python
evidence = QualityEvidence(
    claim_id="claim_123",
    metric_type="test_loss",
    baseline_value=2.5,
    achieved_value=2.0,
    improvement_pct=20.0,
    validation_nodes=["node1", "node2", "node3"],
    evidence_hash="sha256_hash",
    timestamp=time.time()
)
```

### On-Chain Recording

All governance decisions are recorded on-chain with:
- Evidence hash for verification
- Validator signatures
- Justification text
- Timestamp and claim ID

### Threshold Updates

Multiplier thresholds can be updated through governance votes:
1. Proposal submitted with new thresholds
2. 7-day voting period
3. Requires 66% consensus to pass
4. 24-hour timelock before activation

## üìâ Backpay Decay Schedule

To prevent infinite accumulation, old backpay claims progressively decay:

| Age | Retention | Description |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| 0-7 days | 100% | Full value retained |
| 7-14 days | 90% | 10% decay |
| 14-21 days | 70% | 30% decay |
| 21-28 days | 50% | Half value |
| 28-35 days | 30% | Significant decay |
| 35-42 days | 10% | Nearly expired |
| >42 days | 0% | Fully expired |

### Rationale
- Incentivizes timely claim processing
- Prevents unbounded liability
- Frees budget for new contributors
- Still provides grace period for legitimate delays

## üìä Dynamic Budget Scaling

The daily budget adjusts based on network activity:

### Base Calculation
```
Base Daily = (Current Supply √ó 10% Annual Inflation) / 365
```

### Activity Multiplier (0.5√ó to 1.5√ó)
```
Activity Multiplier = Current Active Nodes / Baseline (1000)
```

### Congestion Discount
- Backlog < 1 day: 1.0√ó (no discount)
- Backlog 1-3 days: 0.9√ó (slight reduction)
- Backlog > 3 days: 0.8√ó (reduce new allocation)

### Final Budget
```
Dynamic Budget = Base √ó Activity √ó Congestion
Bounded between 50% and 150% of baseline
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Fairness Enforcement

### Concentration Limits
- No single entity can receive >25% of daily rewards
- Automatic cooldown periods for high earners
- Progressive reduction for repeated claims

### Gini Coefficient Monitoring
- Target Gini < 0.7 (moderate inequality)
- Alert if Gini > 0.8 (high inequality)
- Automatic adjustments to restore balance

### Anti-Sybil Measures
- Unique validator requirements
- Stake-weighted validation
- Reputation-based multipliers

## üîÑ Auto-Tuning Mechanisms

### Epoch Size Adjustment
Distribution frequency auto-tunes based on load:

| Transaction Rate | Epoch Size |
|-----------------|------------|
| >100 claims/hour | 1 hour |
| 10-100 claims/hour | 6 hours |
| <10 claims/hour | 24 hours |

### Budget Rebalancing
Automatic rebalancing when:
- Learning utilization < 15% for 3+ hours
- Any bucket exhausted for 6+ hours
- Backpay queue > 3 days of budget

## üö® Alert Thresholds

### Critical Alerts
- Backpay queue > 200,000 BLY
- Learning bucket < 10% utilization
- Gini coefficient > 0.85
- Single entity > 30% concentration

### Warning Alerts
- Backpay queue > 100,000 BLY
- Learning bucket < 15% utilization
- Gini coefficient > 0.75
- Single entity > 20% concentration

## üìà Scaling Strategies

### Phase 1: Current (1K nodes)
- Hourly distribution
- Manual threshold updates
- Basic decay schedule

### Phase 2: Growth (10K nodes)
- 6-hour epochs
- Automated threshold adjustment
- Progressive decay
- Regional budget pools

### Phase 3: Scale (100K+ nodes)
- Dynamic epoch sizing
- ML-based budget prediction
- Cross-chain settlements
- Layer 2 distribution

## üîê Security Considerations

### Evidence Tampering
- All evidence hashed and signed
- Multiple validator requirement
- Slashing for false evidence

### Budget Manipulation
- Hard caps on daily minting
- Multi-sig for parameter changes
- Timelock on governance updates

### Sybil Attacks
- Proof-of-Learning validation
- Stake requirements for validators
- Reputation decay for bad actors
