# Network Implementation Configuration
## Technical Parameters (Subject to Change)

This document contains implementation-specific configurations that may evolve over time.
These are separated from the immutable Genesis Pact to allow for technical improvements.

---

## 🎯 **Performance-Based Incentives**
```yaml
min_stake: 0                    # Anyone can participate freely
entry_barrier: "none"           # Open to all humanity
reward_basis: "performance_improvement"  # Only technical contribution matters
punishment_method: "no_reward"  # Bad performance = no reward (not economic loss)
```

---

## 🛡️ **Smart Anti-Spam (Phase E)**
```yaml
quality_gate:
  model: "tiny_moe_toxic_v1.onnx"    # Lightweight CPU-only pre-filter
  max_dup_similarity: 0.95           # Auto-reject 95%+ similar models
  max_toxic_score: 0.10              # Toxicity threshold
  min_perplexity_improvement: 0.02   # 2% minimum improvement required
  processing_timeout: "1s"           # 1-second CPU validation
```

---

## 📊 **Progressive Trust System**
```yaml
quota_management:
  newbie_daily: 20                   # New contributors: 20 uploads/day
  trusted_daily: 200                 # Proven contributors: 200 uploads/day
  promotion_threshold: 3             # 3 consecutive successes → trusted
  demotion_threshold: 5              # 5 consecutive failures → newbie
  quota_recovery: "performance_only" # Only successful PoL restores quota
```

---

## 🔍 **Behavioral Anomaly Detection**
```yaml
anomaly_detection:
  min_upload_interval: "5min"        # Prevent rapid-fire uploads
  max_daily_burst: 10                # Max 10 uploads in burst
  suspicious_patterns: ["regular_intervals", "bulk_upload", "off_hours"]
  auto_quarantine: true              # Automatic suspicious node isolation
```

---

## ♻️ **Resource Optimization Philosophy**
```yaml
resource_efficiency:
  validation_as_training: true       # Validation GPU → Training GPU
  failed_models_as_data: true        # Failed experts → Learning data
  zero_waste_principle: "all_computation_contributes_to_ai_advancement"
```

---

## 💰 **Economic Elements**
```yaml
economic_safeguards:
  transaction_fee: 0.01              # Minimal network fee (anti-spam only)
  fee_distribution: "validator_rewards" # All fees → validator compensation
  no_staking_required: true          # Zero economic barriers maintained
```

---

## ⚙️ **Technical Parameters**
```yaml
max_block_size: 10485760  # 10MB max block size
difficulty_adjustment: 2016 # Blocks between difficulty adjustment
consensus_mechanism: "proof_of_learning"
```

---

## 📜 **Data Ethics Implementation**
```yaml
allowed_licenses: ["CC0", "CC-BY", "CC-BY-SA", "Apache-2.0", "MIT"]
data_consent_required: true
privacy_protection: true
```

---

## 🔄 **Evolution Configuration**
These parameters control how the network evolves technically while maintaining the core principles:

```yaml
evolution:
  auto_upgrade_threshold: 0.51      # 51% adoption triggers soft fork
  backward_compatibility: 3          # Support 3 versions back
  deprecation_notice: 90             # 90 days notice before removing features
  emergency_patch_quorum: 0.33      # 33% for critical security fixes
```

---

## 📝 **Notes**
- These configurations can be updated through network governance
- Changes don't require modifying the Genesis Pact
- Implementation details should follow the spirit of the immutable covenant
- Regular review ensures technical progress while maintaining principles
