# Blyan Network Development Roadmap

## Current Status (December 2024)
- ✅ Basic blockchain infrastructure (Chain A, B, D)
- ✅ P2P distributed inference
- ✅ MoE model management
- ✅ Basic learning cycle framework
- 🚧 Production-ready learning cycle
- ⏳ On-chain persistence

## Phase 1: Production Learning Cycle (1-2 weeks)
### Goal: Make learning cycles work reliably in production

### 1.1 Off-chain Persistence Layer
- [ ] PostgreSQL schema for learning state
  - Burns ledger tracking
  - Learning rounds state machine
  - Node registry with capabilities
  - Data assignments tracking
  - Delta submissions storage
  - Validation/consensus records
  - Reward distribution logs

### 1.2 Event-based Communication
- [ ] Idempotency key system
- [ ] Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- [ ] Node signature verification
- [ ] WebSocket fallback for real-time updates

### 1.3 Deterministic Data Sharding
- [ ] Seed-based shard assignment
- [ ] Non-overlapping data distribution
- [ ] Checksum verification
- [ ] Reproducible allocation algorithm

### 1.4 Consensus Mechanism
- [ ] Commit-reveal scheme for deltas
- [ ] Quorum-based validation (M/N threshold)
- [ ] Performance scoring algorithm
- [ ] Byzantine fault tolerance

### 1.5 Reward System
- [ ] Performance-based distribution
- [ ] No slashing (positive incentives only)
- [ ] Proportional allocation
- [ ] Audit trail for all rewards

## Phase 2: On-chain Anchoring (2-4 weeks)
### Goal: Add blockchain trust layer while keeping costs manageable

### 2.1 Smart Contract Infrastructure
```solidity
// Core contracts to deploy
- RoundManager: Learning round state transitions
- NodeRegistry: GPU node registration and reputation
- RewardsVault: Reward pool and distribution
- BurnAccumulator: BLY burn tracking
```

### 2.2 Hybrid Storage Pattern
**On-chain (minimal but critical):**
- Round state transitions
- Seed/registry snapshot roots
- Dataset pool merkle roots
- Assignment merkle roots
- Delta commit/reveal hashes
- Validation score aggregates
- Parameter chain block hashes
- Reward distribution receipts

**Off-chain (large but provable):**
- Actual training logs → IPFS
- Dataset contents → IPFS/S3
- Delta weight files → Parameter chain
- Individual validations → PostgreSQL
- Node communications → PostgreSQL

### 2.3 Merkle Proof System
- [ ] Merkle tree generation for all aggregates
- [ ] Proof verification in smart contracts
- [ ] Client libraries for proof generation
- [ ] Gas-optimized verification

### 2.4 Event Subscription
- [ ] GPU nodes subscribe to on-chain events
- [ ] Fallback to HTTP notifications
- [ ] Event replay for recovery
- [ ] State reconstruction from events

## Phase 3: Full Decentralization (1-2 months)
### Goal: Remove all central dependencies

### 3.1 Autonomous Operation
- [ ] Nodes operate purely from on-chain events
- [ ] No dependency on service node availability
- [ ] Self-organizing expert groups
- [ ] Peer-to-peer delta exchange

### 3.2 Governance Integration
- [ ] DAO-based parameter adjustment
- [ ] Community-driven dataset curation
- [ ] Validator selection mechanism
- [ ] Dispute resolution framework

### 3.3 Economic Sustainability
- [ ] Self-balancing reward pools
- [ ] Dynamic threshold adjustment
- [ ] Market-based resource pricing
- [ ] Long-term incentive alignment

## Phase 4: Scalability & Optimization (2-3 months)
### Goal: Handle massive scale

### 4.1 Layer 2 Integration
- [ ] Rollup for high-frequency operations
- [ ] State channels for node communication
- [ ] Optimistic validation
- [ ] Batch settlement

### 4.2 Sharding & Parallelization
- [ ] Multiple concurrent learning rounds
- [ ] Expert-specific sharding
- [ ] Cross-shard coordination
- [ ] Load balancing

### 4.3 Advanced Features
- [ ] Zero-knowledge proofs for training
- [ ] Homomorphic validation
- [ ] Federated learning primitives
- [ ] Privacy-preserving datasets

## Implementation Principles

### 1. Progressive Decentralization
Start with centralized components for speed, gradually decentralize as the system matures.

### 2. Backward Compatibility
Each phase must maintain compatibility with existing nodes and contracts.

### 3. Economic Viability
Every feature must consider gas costs and economic sustainability.

### 4. Verifiable Computation
All critical computations must be independently verifiable.

### 5. Fail-Safe Design
System should degrade gracefully, never lose funds or data.

## Key Metrics for Success

- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for learning rounds
- **Participation**: >100 active GPU nodes
- **Efficiency**: <$0.10 gas cost per round
- **Latency**: <5 min from trigger to round start
- **Quality**: Measurable model improvements
- **Transparency**: All operations auditable

## Technical Debt to Address

1. **Replace all mock/simulated code with real implementations**
2. **Add comprehensive error handling and recovery**
3. **Implement proper monitoring and alerting**
4. **Create integration test suite**
5. **Document all protocols and APIs**

## Dependencies & Risks

### External Dependencies
- Ethereum/Polygon for smart contracts
- IPFS for decentralized storage
- PostgreSQL for off-chain data
- Redis for caching and queues

### Key Risks
- Gas price volatility
- Network congestion
- Node churn rate
- Dataset quality
- Regulatory changes

## Next Immediate Steps (This Week)

1. ✅ Create PostgreSQL schema for learning persistence
2. ⏳ Implement idempotent event notifications
3. ⏳ Add deterministic sharding algorithm
4. ⏳ Build commit-reveal consensus
5. ⏳ Deploy basic monitoring
